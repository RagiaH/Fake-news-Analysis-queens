# Fake-news-Analysis-queens
In this project, A large dataset for fake news detection using social media news and its related comments is used from
Reddit.
This data is provided from kaggle website which is available on (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepnews/fakenews-
reddit-comments)and is collected from Reddit which is a social news website.
The dataset consists of 69396 records (of which 74 percentage is labelled as real news, the rest is labelled as fake ones)
from three different sources (Snopes, Poltifact and Emergent) which they are fact checked news.
Given a record in textual format, our goal is to automatically detect whether it is fake or not. The dataset is in json
format.
